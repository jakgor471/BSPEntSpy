<h2>Browsing / editing lightmaps</h2>
<hr>

<p>Lightmaps are images "overlayed" on top of the world textures (brushes, displacements) displaying static, baked lighting. Those images 
are not stored in the embedded Pak file as one might expect, instead are stored in separate Lump as raw data. Each face may contain 0 or up to 4 light styles, 
each light style contains either 1 lightmap or 4 if the face's material is bumpmapped (1 "default" lightmap, 3 lightmaps for X, Y and Z axes). When exporting 
the lightmaps are packed into a Zip file named '<i>&lt;map name&gt;</i>_lightmaps.zip' and the lightmap images are named 
'<i>&lt;faceID&gt;</i>_s<i>&lt;styleID&gt;</i>_a<i>&lt;axisID&gt;</i>.png'.</p>

<p>Exported lightmaps may be edited with the software of choice (preferably GIMP). The alpha channel plays important role - each luxel (pixel of a lightmap) contains 4 values: 
RGBE - red, green, blue and exponent being the "brightness" of the luxel. When exporting the exponents are remaped from [-128, 127] to [0, 255] and stored in the image as 
an alpha channel.</p>

<p>In the Lightmap browser some lightmaps are overlayed with "OBSCURED", it does not mean anything.</p>
