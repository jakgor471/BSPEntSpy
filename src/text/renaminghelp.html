<h2>Renaming the map</h2>
<hr>

<p>Renaming the map .bsp file breaks cubemaps on non-world geometry (models, props, weapons etc.). When map is being loaded the Source engine 
loads the Pakfile (containing, amongst others, cubemap textures and patch materials) embedded in the map. To display cubemaps on said geometry the engine 
searches <i>materials/&lt;MAP BSP FILENAME&gt;</i> directory but if such directory is not 
found, due to the BSP file being renamed, the cubemaps are not displayed.</p>
<p>Cubemaps on world geometry however are not affected, as the internal BSP data still points to a valid materials inside the Pakfile.</p>
<p><b>Renaming the map</b> using BSPEntSpy (<i>Map &gt; Rename map</i>) renames the internal material data as well as reorganizes the Pakfile and 
updates the references in patch materials, thus provides a way of completely renaming the map.</p>
<p>Renaming the map takes effect on save. If an external Pakfile is being imported using <i>Map &gt; Import Pak Lump</i>, said Pakfile is going to be 
affected by the renaming process.</p>
