<br><br>

<br><br>

<h2>File syntax HELP</h2>
<hr>
<p>Selected entities are outputted into a text file (.ent extension by default) or directly into the clipboard as a string, of which format is compliant with VMF format:</p>
entity<br>
{<br>
&emsp;"key1" "value1"<br>
&emsp;"key2" "value2"<br>
&emsp;"key3" "value3"<br>
&emsp;...<br>
}<br>
entity<br>
{<br>
&emsp;"key1" "value1"<br>
&emsp;"key2" "value2"<br>
&emsp;"key3" "value3"<br>
&emsp;...<br>
}<br>
...

<p>Such file can be inspected and edited with regular text-editing software like Notepad++.</p>

<h2>Importing from VMF</h2>
<hr>
<p>Because of a compliance with VMF format it is possible to import a whole .VMF file. <b>Note</b> that some entities won't 
get imported due to them being declared as <i>internal entities</i>, that is - they get removed during VBSP step of a map 
compilation and should not exist in the final BSP entity lump.</p>
<p>Allowed brush entities will have their <i>model</i> parameter set to <i>TODO: DEFINE IT!!!</i>. This parameter links 
the entity to a BSP brush model and since brush models are separate from entities one needs to specify them manually.</p>
